## Personal Learnings

It was the first time that I have the option to work with Wordpress. The first steps of the project were challenging in the way to learn all the Wordpress functions used for PHP. After some time, when I became familiar whit the Temple-parts and the functions, I realized why the concept of Wordpress is so popular. It is very flexible to manipulate with the loops and the functions, which allow you to do almost everything - especially if we talk about build-in functions. Positive experience!
